Pick Your Enchantment/ForgeMenuChoice
===========================

![Header image](ForgeMenuChoice/docs/tools.gif)

This mod lets you pick your enchantment at the forge. No longer do you have to save scum to get the enchantment you wanted! Just place your tool or weapon in the left slot, and a prismatic shard in the right, and use the little arrows to select your new enchantment! 

Much thanks to Khloe Leclair for the UI textures! I do strongly recommend you check out [her mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/138772588?tab=user+files). Especially [Almanac](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/11022), which is downright gorgeous.

A small note: the small enchantment choice menu wanders a bit around the screen. This is because I had to implement it as an entirely seperate menu, not connected to the forge menu at all, and I don't actually know how to do UI in a way that isn't jank. It works, but isn't going to win awards for pretty. This is 100% my lack of UI skills and I apologize.
