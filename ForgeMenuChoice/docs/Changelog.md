Changelog
==============

#### Todo
[] Document the tooltip override feature + how to replace the textures in Content Patcher.
[] Add some sort of configurable offset to the menu?
[] Make sure all strings I want translated are complete, and ask for translations.

#### Known issues
* Controllers probably won't be able to lock onto the arrows properly, owing to the....nontraditional menu setup here. It's likely not something I can fix, either.
* The menu may wander a bit if you resize the window or change the zoom. I'm not good at UI, this is literally two different Stardew menus forcibly hacked together.

#### Version 1.0.1
* Added tooltips: hover over the name of the enchantment to get a description. (You may need to find a certain journal scrap first.)
* Slightly adjust the menu for longer enchantment languages in some languages. Fix issue where the enchantment names would not change if you switched languages.
* Made this mod's textures targetable in Content Patcher.

#### Version 1.0.0
* Initial upload.
